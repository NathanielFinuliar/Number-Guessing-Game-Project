# Number-Guessing-Game-Project
This python project is a number guessing game where the players has to guess a digit number(s). As the user guessed the random number, the bot/computer will then have a chance to guess the random number.

# Game Mechanics
The game uses a "hit and blow" mechanism where the player receives "hits" if they correctly guess a digit in the correct position and "blows" if they correctly guess a digit but in the wrong position or index. It can also be Hit(s) and Blow(s) depending on the situation.

# Modifications and Scope of Data Structure & Algorithm
This program includes "H" Help Function that allows the player to check and search if a specific digit is available in the random/guessed number. Furthermore, This project highlights and uses Data Structure and Algorithm concepts such as: Selection Sort, Binary Search, Stacks and Queues.
